# 🏫 Campus Management System using Trees and Graphs

## 📘 Overview
This project demonstrates the use of **advanced data structures** such as **Binary Search Tree (BST)**, **AVL Tree**, **Graph**, and **Expression Trees** in Python through a campus management system example.  
It models campus buildings, their connections, and performs various operations such as searching, traversing, path finding, and evaluating expressions.

## 🧩 Features
### 🔹 Building Management
- Each building is represented as an object (`Building` class).
- Stores **ID**, **Name**, and **Location**.

### 🌲 Binary Search Tree (BST)
- Insert and search buildings by ID.
- Supports **inorder**, **preorder**, and **postorder** traversals.
- Calculates the **height** of the tree.

### 🌳 AVL Tree (Self-Balancing BST)
- Automatically balances after insertions.
- Maintains logarithmic height for faster operations.
- Supports **inorder traversal** and **height calculation**.

### 🕸️ Campus Graph
- Represents connections between buildings.
- Supports:
  - **Adjacency List** and **Adjacency Matrix**
  - **BFS (Breadth-First Search)**
  - **DFS (Depth-First Search)**
  - **Dijkstra’s Shortest Path Algorithm**
  - **Kruskal’s Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)**

### 🧮 Expression Tree
- Builds an expression tree from a **postfix expression**.
- Evaluates expressions with **variables and arithmetic operators** (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^`).
